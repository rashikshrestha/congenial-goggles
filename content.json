{"posts":[{"title":"Sign Language gestures to Speech Gloves","text":"This glove can convert sign language gestures to actual speech. It uses 9 axis motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) to estimate the orientation of the hand, along with one flex sensor on each finger to detect the bendings. The microprocessor used on the gloves then translates the data to the English language and sends it to a custom application on a mobile phone. The app then dictates the received text. This project was done as a part of a hardware hackathon held on Thapathali Campus (Institute of Engineering) and was completed in the time frame of 1 week. The signs used were arbitrary, but can be updated to use standard ones.","link":"/congenial-goggles/2019/12/09/gesture_to_speech/"},{"title":"Hello World","text":"Welcome to Hexo!

An excess amount of solution is placed on an ultraporous substrate that is then rotated at high speed. The liquid spreads due to centrifugal forces and a uniform liquid layer forms on the substrate. A machine used for spin coating is called a spin coater. Though vital laboratory equipment for disease diagnosis, a commercial spin coater is pretty expensive. The cheapest one costs around 150-200 dollars, which is still unaffordable for health clinics and hospitals in rural areas of Nepal. With the help of research labs at RECAST, we developed a high speed (up to 5000 RPM) speed coater prototype with variable speed which could be used for thin fluid coating of the samples. The prototype was developed at one-tenth the cost of a commercial one. Our design showed more or less comparable results to that of commercial ones.","link":"/congenial-goggles/2018/12/09/spin_coater/"},{"title":"Streetfood Vending Machine","text":"Comming soon‚Ä¶","link":"/congenial-goggles/2019/05/09/streetfood_vending_machine/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[{"name":"Project","slug":"Project","link":"/congenial-goggles/categories/Project/"}],"pages":[{"title":"","text":"Bio My research interest includes Robotics, Photogrammetry, SLAM.
